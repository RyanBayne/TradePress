It is a primary driver of poor decision-making, often causing traders to buy at the peak of a bubble. Our process is the antidote to FOMO; every trade is planned and executed based on pre-defined criteria, not on chasing a fast-moving price.'

When you hear this phrase, see it as a signal of high emotion and potential irrationality in the market.'
