It signifies that, for the first time in a while, sellers were able to push the price significantly lower during the day. Even though buyers managed to push it back up by the close, the appearance of such strong selling pressure is a red flag that the uptrend\'s conviction is weakening. As with all reversal signals, it is wise to wait for bearish confirmation on the next candle.'
