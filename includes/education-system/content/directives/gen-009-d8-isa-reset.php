Each tax year, which runs from April 6th to April 5th of the next year, every adult gets a new ISA allowance (currently £20,000). This creates a predictable, seasonal pattern where a large number of retail investors are looking to deploy fresh capital into the market at the beginning of the new tax year.'

The strategy is not about a specific indicator, but about anticipating this flow of funds. Traders might look to buy strong UK stocks in the weeks leading up to April 6th, expecting them to be pushed higher by the wave of retail investment.'

Knowing that a wave of new retail money is about to enter the market, and that this money often flows into popular, well-known stocks, gives you an extra layer of confidence in your long positions. You might decide to add to your positions or be less inclined to take profits, anticipating that the seasonal flow of funds will help push prices higher in early April.'
