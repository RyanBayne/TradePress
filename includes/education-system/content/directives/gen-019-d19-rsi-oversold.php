An oversold reading in a fundamentally sound, leading company (a blue-chip) is often a high-probability buying opportunity, as it is likely to recover. An oversold reading in a speculative stock with no earnings is much riskier, as there is no guarantee it will ever bounce back. The context of the company itself is just as important as the indicator reading.'
