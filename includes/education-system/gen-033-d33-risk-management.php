Without it, even the most profitable strategy will eventually fail. This is not about eliminating risk—which is impossible—but about controlling it. Our process is designed to instill a deep respect for risk and provide the tools to manage it systematically.'

It is a conscious decision made *before* you enter a trade, when you are thinking clearly and rationally, not in the heat of the moment.'

The temptation to move your stop-loss "just a little further" in the hope that the trade will turn around is a primary cause of major losses. Adhering to your pre-defined risk is a non-negotiable part of our process.'
