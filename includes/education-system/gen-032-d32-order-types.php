The type of order you choose is your first point of control over the execution of your trading plan. Choosing the right order type is not just a technical step; it is a reflection of your trading discipline and your psychological preparedness. Our process emphasizes control and intention in every action.'

It forces you to pre-define your entry and exit points based on your analysis, rather than reacting to market movements. It is a conscious decision to let the market come to you. If your order is not filled, it may mean your analysis was incorrect or the opportunity was not right, which is valuable feedback. This is a core tenet of our process: trade with intention, not impulse.'
